# WebWalker
Web crawler with GUI, pulls HTML "&lt;href>" from webpage to explore in search of the user keywords.

9-26 - operational but hangs on thread for crawl execution. Persistent even when button called for stop function to terminate dedicated thread.
     - GUI displays "Walking" text twice.
     - Progress Bar is no longer needed. (next to update)
     - "Current URL" no longer displays crawlers current position correctly, if at all.
